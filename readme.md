# Running the App

To run the app using Flask, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Flask installed. If not, install it using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install Flask
    ```

2. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to the name of your main application file. For example, if your main file is `app.py`, you can set it like this:
    ```sh
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    ```

3. Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can access your app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
